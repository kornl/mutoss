Description: The Mutoss package and accompanying mutossGUI package are
    designed to ease the application and comparison of multiple
    hypothesis testing procedures. The GUI is called with the mutossGUI
    function. Once invoked, the analysis starts by inserting either
    p-values or raw data and specifying the type of analysis and error
    control type wanted. The results can be visualized in the GUI or
    exported as R objects for further analysis- possibly with the
    accompanying compareMutoss functions.
